    "## 1.Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Elementary Cellular Automata\n",
    "\n",
    "**Elementary Cellular Automaton** ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton), [wolfram](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html)) is 1-dimensional cellular automata. It consists of $N$ cells in a row, each being in state 0 or 1. State of cell on next iteration is defined by a state of this cell and its 2 neigbors on previous iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules.** There are $2^3=8$ possible combinations of state of cell and its neigbors, and to fully define transition rule we ned for every combination specify new state (0 or 1). Therefore, there are $2^8=256$ possible rules and they can be codified by integers from 0 to 255. These integers fully define transitions and are referred to as \"[Wolfram codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_code)\" or simply \"rules\". So, there are in total 256 different Elementary Cellular Automata.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Border conditions.** To fully define transitions in case of finite $N$ we need to define border conditions. We will consider 2 of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Periodic**. Leftmost and rightmost cells are considered neighbors.\n",
    "* **Fixed**. We consider that to the left of first cell and to the right of right cell there is a cell in state 0 which is never updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulating ECA by a quantum cirquit\n",
    "\n",
    "We represent ECA by a registed of $N$ qubits. Quantum state |0> of qubit to represent classical state 0 of cell and quantum state |1> represents classical state 1 of cell. Therefore, each of $2^N$ basis states of quantum register correspond to all possible states of classical ECA. We want for given rule find such a unitary that, when applied to given state, transorms it exactly like classical rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we don't consider superpositions of basis states and there are no measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective of this notebook is to find all rules for which it's in principle possible to find corresponding unitary, and for all of them provide instruction how to construct this unitary as a quantum circuit made of $O(N)$ quantum gates acting only on 1,2 or 3 qubits."

    "## 2. Finding all reversible rules\n",
    "\n",
    "From our definitions it follows that unitary matrix must map basis states to basis states. Unitary matrix with such property is permutation matrix. So, only a rule which enacts permutation on set of all classical states of ECA can be made into unitary matrix. Indeed, if rule transforms two states A and B into the same state C, it's not reversible, but quantum computation must be reversible.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use brute force approach to find all reversible rules. For this we check all 256 rules and 2 border conditions. For every of them consider all $2^N$ classical states (encoded as ointegers from 0 to $2^N-1$), and for every of them consider $f(s)$ - encoded state to which rule takes state $s$. Then we check if sequence $0, 1, \\dots, d(2^N-1)$ is a permutation. \n",
    "\n",
    "We repeat this for a range of $N$ and we hypothesise that if this is a permutation for small $N$, it will be for all $N$. We don't have to prove this hypothesis, because this step is used only to quickly discard irreversible rules. Below for every reversible rule we will construct a unitary and by doing that prove that it's reversible."
