## Quantum Artihmetic

In this folder I put some helper code for implementing various quantum arithmetic algorihtms.
I use this code to test the classical algorithms before implementing them in Q#.

This is part of the project on resource estimation for quantum arithmetic.

The Q# code is located [in this repository](https://github.com/fedimser/quant-arith-re).
